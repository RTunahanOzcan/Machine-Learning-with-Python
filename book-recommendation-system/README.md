# Book Recommendation System (KNN)

## üìñ Project Overview
This project implements a **book recommendation system** using the [Book-Crossings dataset](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/).  
The system applies the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to recommend books that are most similar to a given book, based on collaborative filtering of user ratings.

The dataset includes:
- 1.1 million ratings (scale: 1‚Äì10, with 0 meaning implicit feedback only)
- 270,000 books
- 90,000 users

Our goal is to create a `get_recommends` function that outputs the 5 most similar books for any given title.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Steps

1. **Imports**
   - `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy.sparse`, `sklearn.neighbors`, `os`

2. **Data Loading**
   - Load `BX-Books.csv` (ISBN, title, author)
   - Load `BX-Book-Ratings.csv` (user, ISBN, rating)

3. **Preprocessing**
   - Keep only books with **‚â•100 ratings**
   - Keep only users with **‚â•200 ratings**
   - Remove ratings equal to `0` (implicit feedback)
   - Pivot ratings into a user‚Äìbook matrix (`users` as rows, `books` as columns)
   - Fill missing values with `0`

4. **Model Training**
   - Use `NearestNeighbors` from `sklearn.neighbors`
   - Metric: cosine similarity
   - Fit the KNN model on the sparse matrix of book features

5. **Recommendation Function**
   ```python
   def get_recommends(title=""):
       # input: book title
       # output: [input_title, [[similar_book, distance], ...]]
  ```     
## üéØ Example
```python
get_recommends("The Queen of the Damned (Vampire Chronicles (Paperback))")

[
  "The Queen of the Damned (Vampire Chronicles (Paperback))",
  [
    ["Catch 22", 0.79],
    ["The Witching Hour (Lives of the Mayfair Witches)", 0.74],
    ["Interview with the Vampire", 0.73],
    ["The Tale of the Body Thief (Vampire Chronicles (Paperback))", 0.54],
    ["The Vampire Lestat (Vampire Chronicles, Book II)", 0.52]
  ]
]
```
## üìå Notes
 - Distance metric is **cosine similarity**; smaller values mean closer recommendations.  
- Distances are **rounded to 2 decimal places** for cleaner output.  

## ‚úÖ Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Libraries:  
  - numpy  
  - pandas  
  - scipy  
  - scikit-learn
